1. +DeviceID verification is ready
2. +Proceed with Erase Program & verification
3. +Generate Erase files only, and debug it.
4. +Program using the tool and Debug verification only.
5. +Try whole batch - Erase Program & Verify
=== As a result the programming passed, but the execution time is 50mins!
    Most of time the write transaction looks like
	write COMMAND PROGRAM, write DATA, delay, write COMMAND GET_STATUS (or something similar (0xF0000000), read 1 byte (probably status)
    These transactions cana be combined into a one and  passed as a batch with more prcisious delay on MCU side.

6. +Get SPI timing on th Diamond Programmer
    Write timing Write & read at 15MHz has no impact
    The biggest impact is a 1.2ms delay between write and check. total time is 51sec
    Read timing - 8bytes burst every 100us - total time few seconds

    Using HOST machine as a command source 1ms delay isn't feasible. Probably
    it is worth to consider move Lattice SSPIEM player into FW atleast partially.

    SPI transaction fails some times then running not under MSVC.... seems the problem is on MCU side.
    MCU can't be programmed. Either problem in program cable or power. 	Try to program using tne DFU.
    After yet another attempt MCU cycle in the loop where power controller reset exactly at the same time (~62ms after power up). 
    Looks like the MCU drives a pin that cause the short circuit.
    After soldering iron poking and cleaning issue is gone `\_;/_/` and FPGA programming PASSED

6.1 Need to precise the minimum allowed delay

============

7. Combine multiple packets
