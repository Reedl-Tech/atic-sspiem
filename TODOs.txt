1. +DeviceID verification is ready
2. +Proceed with Erase Program & verification
3. +Generate Erase files only, and debug it.
4. +Program using the tool and Debug verification only.
5. +Try whole batch - Erase Program & Verify
=== As a result the programming passed, but the execution time is 50mins!
    Most of time the write transaction looks like
	write COMMAND PROGRAM, write DATA, delay, write COMMAND GET_STATUS (or something similar (0xF0000000), read 1 byte (probably status)
    These transactions cana be combined into a one and  passed as a batch with more prcisious delay on MCU side.

6. +Get SPI timing on th Diamond Programmer
    Write timing Write & read at 15MHz has no impact
    The biggest impact is a 1.2ms delay between write and check. total time is 51sec
    Read timing - 8bytes burst every 100us - total time few seconds

    Using HOST machine as a command source 1ms delay isn't feasible. Probably
    it is worth to consider move Lattice SSPIEM player into FW atleast partially.

6.1 Need to precise the minimum allowed delay

============

7. Combine multiple packets
